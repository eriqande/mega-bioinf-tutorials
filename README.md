This repository houses a few simple Rmds that get converted to GitHub
flavored markdown so I can quickly put down a few simple tutorials for
the MEGA group bioinformatics crew.

Currently:

- [list-columns-and-purr.md](./list-columns-and-purr.md) A short
  tutorial I did on how to use list columns in the tidyverse. (Winter
  2025).
