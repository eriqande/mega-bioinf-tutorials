# mega-bioinf-tutorials

<!-- badges: start -->

This repository houses a few simple Rmds that get converted to GitHub flavored
markdown so I can quickly put down a few simple tutorials for the MEGA group
bioinformatics crew.

Currently:

- [list-columns-and-purr.md](./list-columns-and-purr.md) A short tutorial I did on how
to use list columns in the tidyverse. (Winter 2025).
- [mega-non-model.md](./mega-non-model.md) A tutorial on how to set up a run for the
mega-non-model pipeline, with particular emphasis on the new features that I added to
make it easier to do initial QC step for the landscape genomics projects we have going
on in the lab.
